						Dose Remainder 

OVERVIEW:
	This project centeres around the production of a medical box system which sends alerts to the user
when the time for taking medicine comes.  The owner of the medicine box should take the medicine as they naturally should.
The Machine Learning algorithm will eventually learn the schedule of the times and send alerts to the user when the time comes.
The ALgorithm will eventually learn if the user decides to change their schedules and alerts the user accordingly.
This technology will be used for those who take multiple types of medicine in their lives. This medicine is 
tailored towards the sick and the elderly.  Some of the challenges that will be faced when building this is managing scalability when the number of medicine boxes inevetibly increases.
